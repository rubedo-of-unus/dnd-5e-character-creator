# D&D 5th Edition Character Creator (2014 Ruleset)
## Background
The application is aimed to creating conveniences for players that wish to create a character using the rules of 5th edition. Though many applications exist for that purpose, this solution does not restrict any races, classes or backgrounds behind memberships, subscriptions or payments. In addition, this solution allows the user to create their own races, classes and backgrounds for homebrewing purposes.

## Installation and Usage
1. Download the repository (Zipped Folder)
2. Unzip the folder in the desired destination folder
3. Double-click on the file `index.html` => this will open the file on your default browser

NOTE: If you understand HTML, CSS or JavaScript, feel free to edit the files as necessary. However, if you lack any programmatic knowledge, do not change anything in the code, as it may ruin the application.
